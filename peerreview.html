    <h1>Proximity</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Name: Amazon</li>
        <li>URL:amazon.com</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <img src="/cit230/images/file4.png" width="200" height="300" alt="Amazons Webiste">
        <br> i feel like this picture does a good job at showing off how proximity works as an atrribute. It brings multiple pictures together that are related in what they are trying to sale. they are links to products for young children.
    </p>
    <h1>Alignment</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Name: Nike</li>
        <li>URL: nike.com</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <img src="cit230/images/nike.png" width="200" height="300" alt="nike shoes"><br> I feel like the most important part of the alignment attribute is to make everything clear. you can scroll through the majority of nikes website and not see any issues with this. in the picture you can see that they have the product or the type of product and then cleary explain it under the picture with out interferance.
    </p>
    <h1>Repetition</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Name: Apple</li>
        <li>URL: apple.com</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <img src="cit230/images/apple.png" width="200" height="300" alt="Apple Watch"><br> I didnt pick this just because its called repetition and there is several images of an apple watch. i picked it because what it describes. you could take the words away from the picture and you could tell what they are trying to sale.
    </p>
    <h1>Contrast</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Name: Fatcats movie theater </li>
        <li>URL: fatcatsfun.com/rexburg</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <img src="cit230/images/movie.png" width="200" height="300" alt="Movies"><br> i was struggling trying to find one for this, however i feel like i found a good one. the reason this works with contrast is because the whole screen is black and the only thing that you can see is the images of the movies. with that you know what the purpose of this webiste is for. you come to this site to pick a movie to see and to pick a time to go.
    </p>
    <h1>Typography</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Name:Textile Graphix</li>
        <li>URL: not functioning yet but will be textilegrpahix.com</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <img src="cit230/images/tg.png" width="200" height="300" alt="Textile Graphix"><br> this website is not up and running yet but it is the webiste for where i work and it is in the process of getting up and running. how ever i really like the fonts and styles that they have used with this webiste and the color of the blue box makes it pop. when they are talking about the free shipping. i like simple looking fonts so i am boring when it comes to this stuff though.
